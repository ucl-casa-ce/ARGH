Augmented Reality Grounded Heritage: Portholes for Environmental and Youth Stories

ARGH! Mateys invites people to walk and discover environmental and youth stories hidden in digital portholes located in the Royal Docks. Find the keywords engraved on portholes placed in sites chosen by local young people, and use them to unlock messages from imagined futures either via either sms or Augmented Reality.
